Welcome to my Machine Learning project where I developed a predictive model for college admissions using various regression techniques. This project was completed as part of my coursework and demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment using **Streamlit**.

## 📊 Project Description

This project explores and implements machine learning algorithms to predict the chances of a student getting admitted to a university based on various academic and non-academic factors. The dataset includes variables like GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research experience.


Models used:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- K-Fold Cross Validation

The best-performing model was deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.
